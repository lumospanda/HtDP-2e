# hello-world
Main repository for my learning projects

lumospanda here! (The name is a play on "Firefox" that I came up with in the shower.)
This repository will most likely follow the [draft 2nd edition of *How to Design Programs*] (<http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/Draft/index.html>) by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, and Shriram Krishnamurthi. Any substantial code exercises I write while working through the textbook will end up here.
